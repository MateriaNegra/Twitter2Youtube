So the whole point of this project is this:

To be able to grab a twitter accounts posting such as @bpm_playlist and make
it possible to get a youtube or maybe even grooveshark (maybe...) search and
first result up and running in a matter of seconds. The language I'll be
approaching this with is PHP.... Hence that this is also my first project to
coding at all.


Hopefully I can get somewhere in the next couple weeks.
